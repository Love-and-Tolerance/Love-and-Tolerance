# Support

We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/y8cybKe), where you can get support. This is probably the best way to get help. Here is an invite: [https://discord.gg/y8cybKe](https://discord.gg/y8cybKe)

If you can't contact via Discord, you can create an issue on the main repository [here](https://github.com/Love-and-Tolerance/Love-and-Tolerance/issues/new/choose).

You can also contact us via [email](mailto:contact@love-tolerance.com).
