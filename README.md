# Love & Tolerance

![L&T][Banner]

L&T is a Minecraft resource pack inspired by the visual art style and design of the show _My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic_. Bright colors and (moderate) pony references abound!

## Features

### Java & Bedrock
- Bright and colorful textures, just like the show, but not to dissimilar to the default textures, so your builds don't look completely different.
- Moderate pony references, such as: pony themed paintings, Ponk hiding inside a low percentage of barrels, pony themed holiday add-ons and more.
- Has various add-ons allowing users to customize the pack to their liking.
- Both [Java] and [Bedrock] (MCPE and Windows 10) editions are available.
- Created on the Brohoof Forums, it was used on their map of [Equestria] so builders had a consistent experience building the map.

### Java Specific
- Has compatibility with [Mine Little Pony][MineLP] and its ponified mobs.
- Has a custom download system, allowing you to download one file with all the selected add-ons.
- Has support for connected textures, mob variety, and more in an add-on compatible with [Optifine], [Continuity], and [Entity Texture Features].

## Download

The pack is available from these places:

- [Love & Tolerance Website][Downloads] (Recommended) - Java, Bedrock, Custom Java Downloads
- [Modrinth] - Java
